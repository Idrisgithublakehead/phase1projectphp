# Cookies Shop Online, idris zahir, final project phase 1


This is my Phase 1 PHP and CSS website project.  
It’s a small online cookie shop made to show what I’ve learned so far with HTML, PHP includes, CSS, and a basic database setup.

##  What this project is about

The goal was to build a working layout for a store website with a few pages and a nice design.  
Right now everything is static (no database connection yet).  
It just shows how the site will look and feel before adding real backend stuff later. phase 1 is just layout

## what  I used

- **HTML / CSS** for the layout and design  
- **PHP** for templating (header & footer includes)  
- **MySQL + phpMyAdmin** for testing the database tables  
- **AWS LAMP Server** to host it online  
- **GitHub + VS Code** for saving changes and version control

##  Database info

There’s a few tables made for users, products, orders, and order items.  
They don’t connect to the pages yet, but the structure is there in `database/project_db.sql`.


##  What’s actually done in Phase 1

- All main pages made (home, about, shop, contact, register, login)   
- Two Google Fonts (Inter + Playfair Display)   
- Works on phones and smaller screens  
- Everything hosted live  
- GitHub shows multiple commits along the way  
-etc
